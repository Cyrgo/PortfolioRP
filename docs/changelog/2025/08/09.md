# üìã August 9, 2025 - Development Log

## Session 1 - Project Review & Organization

**Time:** Early morning session  
**Focus:** Reviewing project status and organizing documentation

### Changes Made:

#### üìÅ Documentation Reorganization
**Moved:** All documentation files to `docs/` folder
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` ‚Üí `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md`
- `MYSQL_WORKBENCH_SETUP.md` ‚Üí `docs/MYSQL_WORKBENCH_SETUP.md`  
- `QBCORE_SETUP.md` ‚Üí `docs/QBCORE_SETUP.md`
- `QUICK_MYSQL_SETUP.md` ‚Üí `docs/QUICK_MYSQL_SETUP.md`
- `RESOURCES_INFO.md` ‚Üí `docs/RESOURCES_INFO.md`
- `SQLITE_DEV.md` ‚Üí `docs/SQLITE_DEV.md`
- `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` ‚Üí `docs/TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
- `VOICE_GUIDE.md` ‚Üí `docs/VOICE_GUIDE.md`
- **Reason:** Better project organization, keeping root directory clean

#### üìù File Updates
**Updated:** `README.md`
- Modified project structure section to reflect new `docs/` folder organization
- **Reason:** Keep documentation accurate

**Updated:** `server.cfg`  
- Changed MySQL setup references from `QUICK_MYSQL_SETUP.md` to `docs/QUICK_MYSQL_SETUP.md`
- **Reason:** Fix broken references after moving documentation files

#### ‚ú® Changelog System Implementation
**Added:** Comprehensive changelog management system
- Created initial `docs/CHANGELOG.md` file
- Added detailed changelog instructions to `CLAUDE.md`
- **Reason:** User requested detailed logging of all project changes

**Updated:** `CLAUDE.md`
- Added changelog management section with formatting guidelines
- Defined change categories (Added, Fixed, Updated, Removed, Moved, Config, Docs)
- **Reason:** Ensure consistent change tracking

**Restructured:** Changelog organization
- Created `docs/changelog/` directory structure
- Organized by year/month folders (2025/08/)
- Split into daily log files (09.md for today)
- Created changelog index at `docs/changelog/README.md`
- Removed old monolithic `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new file structure instructions
- **Reason:** User requested better organization with daily files in monthly folders

### Project Status Review:

#### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- FiveM server files installed (FXServer.exe present)
- Server configured with license key
- All QBCore resources downloaded and placed
- Server has been run before (cache folder exists)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Attention:
- MySQL not installed (database functionality disabled)
- oxmysql commented out in server.cfg (line 35)
- ox_inventory commented out in server.cfg (line 50)
- Most resources untracked in git (shown as ?? in git status)

#### üìä Overall Status:
- Server is ~80% complete
- Can start but runs in limited mode without database
- No data persistence (characters, money, inventory won't save between sessions)

### Notes:
- Server needs MySQL installation to be fully functional
- All resources are present but need database for persistence
- Documentation now better organized for easier navigation

## Session 2 - Documentation Cleanup

**Time:** Morning session continuation
**Focus:** Streamlining documentation files

### Changes Made:

#### üóëÔ∏è Deleted Outdated Documentation
**Removed:** Obsolete documentation files
- Deleted `RESOURCES_INFO.md` - Outdated, referred to old standalone resources before QBCore
- Deleted `SQLITE_DEV.md` - No longer relevant with QBCore requiring MySQL
- Deleted `MYSQL_WORKBENCH_SETUP.md` - Redundant with DATABASE_SETUP.md
- **Reason:** These files contained outdated or misleading information

#### üìù Merged and Enhanced Documentation
**Updated:** `DATABASE_SETUP.md`
- Added "Quick Start" section from QUICK_MYSQL_SETUP.md
- Integrated XAMPP quick setup as primary method
- Added "What Database Enables" section showing benefits
- Improved step-by-step instructions with clearer formatting
- **Reason:** Consolidated all database setup info into one comprehensive guide

**Removed:** `QUICK_MYSQL_SETUP.md`
- Content merged into DATABASE_SETUP.md
- **Reason:** Eliminated redundancy while preserving useful content

### Documentation Status:

#### üìö Remaining Documentation (4 files):
1. **DATABASE_SETUP.md** - Complete MySQL setup guide (enhanced)
2. **QBCORE_SETUP.md** - QBCore framework reference
3. **TEST_CHECKLIST.md** - Server testing procedures
4. **VOICE_GUIDE.md** - Voice system documentation

#### Benefits:
- Reduced documentation from 8 files to 4 essential guides
- Eliminated outdated and confusing information
- Consolidated database setup into single source of truth
- Clearer, more focused documentation set
