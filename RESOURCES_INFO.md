## Server Configuration

All resources have been added to `server.cfg` and will automatically start when the server launches.

## Testing the Server

To test the server with new resources:
1. Run `start.bat` or navigate to server folder and run `FXServer.exe +exec ../server.cfg`
2. Connect to the server using FiveM client (F8 â†’ `connect localhost:30120`)
3. Test commands:
   - Chat: `/me tests the chat`, `/ooc Hello everyone!`
   - Emotes: `/emotes` to see list, `/e dance` to dance
   - Admin: Press M to open vMenu (requires admin permissions)

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
- **Economy System**: Banking, money, shops

## Framework Options for Future

- **ESX**: Older but stable, large community
- **Standalone Development**: Continue building custom resources without framework
